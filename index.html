        Hello, my name is Robert, and I live in Durham with my wife and our <b>five</b> cats (two of them
        we ended up with accidentally, but we couldn't bring ourselves to part with them). I am attending
        this bootcamp because I have been working in retail and sales for the past 17 years and I am ready
        for a change of pace. COVID-19 was the final push I needed to realize it was time to make a change.
    </p>
    </p>
        When I am not at work (which feels like all the the time these days), I like to spend my time 
        either listen to or making music. I get together with some friends once a week and we go through
        different artists discographies one album at a time. I am also currently on a personal quest to 
        watch 365 movies this calender year, and I am currently on track to accomplish this goal. Being stuck
        at home with no social commitments has certainly helped me with this endeavor. 
    </p>
